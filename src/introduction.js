        . Which one should you help?


        <p />There are online lists of developers looking for help. But they don't give you any indication of who deserves funding.
        Unless youâ€™re already familiar with the technology and working in the Bitcoin trenches, it can be difficult and time-consuming to figure out who is doing good work.

        <p />But bitcoin developers <i>are</i> familiar with the technology. They <i>are</i> working in the trenches. Why not leverage their knowledge to help you pick someone?

        <p />Bitcoin Bootstrap does exactly this by allowing developers to vote on the other developers they think deserves funding. Each vote represents a developers cumulative knowledge on who is best working towards the desired goals and most deserving of financial help.

        <p />Only contributors to the Bitcoin repository are allowed on the candidate list, and only contributors to the repository are allowed to vote on them.

        <p />See the list below.
